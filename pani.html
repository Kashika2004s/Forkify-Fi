  </div>
  <div class="sa">
    <p class="p">To prepare pani Puri:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><p>To make puris, mix semolina, all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt in a<br> bowl. Gradually add water and knead into a stiff dough.</p></li> 
      <li><p>Cover and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.Divide the dough into small balls.</p></li> 
      <li><p>Roll out each ball into a thin circle, around 2-3 inches in diameter.<br>
      Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium heat.</p></li> 
      <li><p>Once the oil is hot, fry the rolled-out puris until they puff up and turn <br>golden brown. Remove them from the oil and drain on paper towels.</p></li>
      <li><p>To make pani, blend mint leaves, cilantro, green chilies, ginger, tamarind<br> pulp, jaggery or sugar, roasted cumin powder, chaat masala, black salt, regular<br> salt, and water in a blender until smooth. </p></li>
      <li><p>Adjust the consistency with water as needed. Strain the mixture to remove<br> any fibers or solids.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>To assemble, gently make a small hole in the top of each puri. Fill each <br>puri with a teaspoon of mashed potatoes, boiled chickpeas, and chopped <br>onions. Drizzle some tamarind chutney and sprinkle chaat masala on top.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>Serve the filled puris with the prepared pani. Allow each person to pour<br> the pani into their puris just before eating to keep them crispy.</p></li>
      <li><p>Enjoy the burst of flavors and textures in each bite!</p></li><br>
