    <p class="p">To prepare Sugar Syrup:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><p>In a saucepan, combine sugar and water. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring until<br> the sugar dissolves completely</p></li>

      <li><p>Add cardamom powder and saffron strands (if using).Simmer <br> 
      the syrup over medium heat for about 5-7 minutes until it slightly <br>thickens.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Turn off the heat and add rose water. Keep the syrup warm.In a mixing bowl, <br>combine crumbled khoya, all-purpose flour, semolina (if using),<br>baking soda, and cardamom powder. </p></li>
        
      <li><p>Mix well until everything is combined.Gradually add milk, a little at a time,<br>and knead the mixture into a smooth and soft dough. Be cautious not to <br>over-knead the dough.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Divide the dough into small equal-sized portions and roll each portion between<br>your palms to form smooth balls without any cracks. Ensure there are no cracks, as<br> they can cause the jamuns to break while frying.</p></li>
        
      <li><p>Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium-low heat. Once the oil is<br>hot, gently slide the prepared jamun balls into the oil, making sure not to overcrowd <br>the pan. Fry the balls in batches, stirring gently and occasionally, until they turn <br>golden brown and evenly cooked from all sides. </p></li>
        
      <li><p>Remove the fried jamun balls from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain <br>them on paper towels to remove excess oil.</p></li>

      <li><p>Immediately transfer the fried jamun balls to the warm sugar syrup. Let them soak<br>in the syrup for at least 1-2 hours, allowing the jamuns to absorb the syrup and <br>become soft and flavorful.</p></li>

      <li><p>Serve gulab jamun warm or at room temperature. Optionally, garnish with <br>chopped nuts like pistachios or almonds before serving. Enjoy the deliciousness <br>of homemade gulab jamun!</p></li><br>
